        "content": "The obsession with 'following your passion' is privileged garbage that's left an entire generation broke and disillusioned. Most people don't have some burning, monetizable passion waiting to be discovered - they have bills to pay and responsibilities to meet. This fairy tale that you should love what you do for work has created unrealistic expectations and made people feel like failures for having normal jobs that simply provide financial stability. The whole 'do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life' mantra is usually spouted by people who already had money or got lucky, ignoring the reality that most passions don't pay well and most well-paying jobs involve plenty of mundane, unglamorous work. People would be happier if they focused on developing competence in valuable skills, building financial security, and finding meaning outside of work instead of torturing themselves trying to turn every hobby into a career.",

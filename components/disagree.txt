I get where you're coming from, but I don’t think it’s that simple. 
If we start expecting payment for just browsing the internet, it could lead to more data collection,
more tracking, and even more invasive ads. 
I’d rather keep my privacy and not sell my data for a few bucks a month. 
Sometimes it’s better to keep the lines clear: my data isn’t for sale.
